# Unity FPS Multi-Counter

The FPS Multi-Counter will measure the current frames per second of your application. It's called multi counter because besides measuring the average fps, it will also measure the highest and lowest framerates on a defined interval.

To use this plugin, simply drag the FPS Counter from the Prefabs folder and drop as a child of the scene Canvas.
